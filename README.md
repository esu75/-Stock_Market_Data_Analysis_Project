----------------------------------
For this project VBA scripting is used to analyze generated stock market data
Goal:

Create a script that loops through all the stocks and outputs the following information:

      a. The ticker symbol

      b. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

      c. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

      d. The total stock volume of the stock. 
      e. Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
      f. Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (i.e, years: 2018, 2019 and 2020) at once.
